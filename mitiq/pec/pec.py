    input circuit, via the application of probabilistic error cancellation
    (PEC). :cite:`Temme_2017_PRL` :cite:`Endo_2018_PRX`.

    This function implements PEC by:

    1. Sampling different implementable circuits from the quasi-probability
       representation of the input circuit;
    2. Evaluating the noisy expectation values associated to the sampled
       circuits (through the "executor" function provided by the user);
    3. Estimating the ideal expectation value from a suitable linear
       combination of the noisy ones.

    Args:
        circuit: The input circuit to execute with error-mitigation.
        executor: A Mitiq executor that executes a circuit and returns the
            unmitigated ``QuantumResult`` (e.g. an expectation value).
        observable: Observable to compute the expectation value of. If None,
            the `executor` must return an expectation value. Otherwise,
            the `QuantumResult` returned by `executor` is used to compute the
            expectation of the observable.
        representations: Representations (basis expansions) of each operation
            in the input circuit.
        precision: The desired estimation precision (assuming the observable
            is bounded by 1). The number of samples is deduced according
            to the formula (one_norm / precision) ** 2, where 'one_norm'
            is related to the negativity of the quasi-probability
            representation :cite:`Temme_2017_PRL`. If 'num_samples' is
            explicitly set by the user, 'precision' is ignored and has no
            effect.
        num_samples: The number of noisy circuits to be sampled for PEC.
            If not given, this is deduced from the argument 'precision'.
        force_run_all: If True, all sampled circuits are executed regardless of
            uniqueness, else a minimal unique set is executed.
        random_state: Seed for sampling circuits.
        full_output: If False only the average PEC value is returned.
            If True a dictionary containing all PEC data is returned too.

    Returns:
        The tuple ``(pec_value, pec_data)`` where ``pec_value`` is the
        expectation value estimated with PEC and ``pec_data`` is a dictionary
        which contains all the raw data involved in the PEC process (including
        the PEC estimation error).
        The error is estimated as ``pec_std / sqrt(num_samples)``, where
        ``pec_std`` is the standard deviation of the PEC samples, i.e., the
        square root of the mean squared deviation of the sampled values from
        ``pec_value``. If ``full_output`` is ``False``, only ``pec_value`` is
