def represent_operation_with_global_depolarizing_noise(
    ideal_operation: QPROGRAM, noise_level: float
) -> OperationRepresentation:
    r"""As described in :cite:`Temme_2017_PRL`, this function maps an
    ``ideal_operation`` :math:`\mathcal{U}` into its quasi-probability
    representation, which is a linear combination of noisy implementable
    operations :math:`\sum_\alpha \eta_{\alpha} \mathcal{O}_{\alpha}`.

    This function assumes a depolarizing noise model and, more precicely,
    that the following noisy operations are implementable
    :math:`\mathcal{O}_{\alpha} = \mathcal{D} \circ \mathcal P_\alpha
    \circ \mathcal{U}`, where :math:`\mathcal{U}` is the unitary associated
    to the input ``ideal_operation`` acting on :math:`k` qubits,
    :math:`\mathcal{P}_\alpha` is a Pauli operation and
    :math:`\mathcal{D}(\rho) = (1 - \epsilon) \rho + \epsilon I/2^k` is a
    depolarizing channel (:math:`\epsilon` is a simple function of
    ``noise_level``).

    For a single-qubit ``ideal_operation``, the representation is as
    follows:

    .. math::
         \mathcal{U}_{\beta} = \eta_1 \mathcal{O}_1 + \eta_2 \mathcal{O}_2 +
                               \eta_3 \mathcal{O}_3 + \eta_4 \mathcal{O}_4

    .. math::
        \eta_1 =1 + \frac{3}{4} \frac{\epsilon}{1- \epsilon},
        \qquad \mathcal{O}_1 = \mathcal{D} \circ \mathcal{I} \circ \mathcal{U}

        \eta_2 =- \frac{1}{4}\frac{\epsilon}{1- \epsilon} , \qquad
        \mathcal{O}_2 = \mathcal{D} \circ \mathcal{X} \circ \mathcal{U}

        \eta_3 =- \frac{1}{4}\frac{\epsilon}{1- \epsilon} , \qquad
        \mathcal{O}_3 = \mathcal{D} \circ \mathcal{Y} \circ \mathcal{U}

        \eta_4 =- \frac{1}{4}\frac{\epsilon}{1- \epsilon} , \qquad
        \mathcal{O}_4 = \mathcal{D} \circ \mathcal{Z} \circ \mathcal{U}

    It was proven in :cite:`Takagi_2020_PRR` that, under suitable assumptions,
    this representation is optimal (minimum 1-norm).

    Args:
        ideal_operation: The ideal operation (as a QPROGRAM) to represent.
        noise_level: The noise level (as a float) of the depolarizing channel.

    Returns:
        The quasi-probability representation of the ``ideal_operation``.

    .. note::
        This representation is based on the ideal assumption that one
        can append Pauli gates to a noisy operation without introducing
        additional noise. For a backend which violates this assumption,
        it remains a good approximation for small values of ``noise_level``.

    .. note::
        The input ``ideal_operation`` is typically a QPROGRAM with a single
        gate but could also correspond to a sequence of more gates.
        This is possible as long as the unitary associated to the input
        QPROGRAM, followed by a single final depolarizing channel, is
        physically implementable.
