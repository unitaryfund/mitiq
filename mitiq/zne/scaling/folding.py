        scale_factor: Factor to scale the circuit by. Any real number >= 1.
        seed: Seed for random number generator.

    Keyword Args:
        fidelities (Dict[str, float]): Dictionary of gate fidelities. Each key
            is a string which specifies the gate and each value is the
            fidelity of that gate. When this argument is provided, folded
            gates contribute an amount proportional to their infidelity
            (1 - fidelity) to the total noise scaling. Fidelity values must be
            in the interval (0, 1]. Gates not specified have a default
            fidelity of 0.99**n where n is the number of qubits the gates act
            on.

            Supported gate keys are listed in the following table.::

                Gate key    | Gate
                -------------------------
                "H"         | Hadamard
                "X"         | Pauli X
                "Y"         | Pauli Y
                "Z"         | Pauli Z
                "I"         | Identity
                "S"         | Phase gate
                "T"         | T gate
                "rx"        | X-rotation
                "ry"        | Y-rotation
                "rz"        | Z-rotation
                "CNOT"      | CNOT
                "CZ"        | CZ gate
                "SWAP"      | Swap
                "ISWAP"     | Imaginary swap
                "CSWAP"     | CSWAP
                "TOFFOLI"   | Toffoli gate
                "single"    | All single qubit gates
                "double"    | All two-qubit gates
                "triple"    | All three-qubit gates

            Keys for specific gates override values set by "single", "double",
            and "triple".

            For example, `fidelities = {"single": 1.0, "H", 0.99}` sets all
            single-qubit gates except Hadamard to have fidelity one.

        squash_moments (bool): If True, all gates (including folded gates) are
            placed as early as possible in the circuit. If False, new moments
            are created for folded gates. This option only applies to QPROGRAM
            types which have a "moment" or "time" structure. Default is True.

        return_mitiq (bool): If True, returns a Mitiq circuit instead of
            the input circuit type (if different). Default is False.

    Returns:
        folded: The folded quantum circuit as a QPROGRAM.
