    """Applies a variable amount of folding to select layers of a circuit.

    Note that this method only works for the univariate extrapolation methods.

        If you would prefer to
        use a multivariate extrapolation method for unitary
        folding, use
        :func:`mitiq.lre.multivariate_scaling.layerwise_folding` instead.

        The layerwise folding required for multivariate extrapolation is
        different as the layers in the input circuit have to be scaled in
        a specific pattern. The required specific pattern for multivariate
        extrapolation does not allow a user to provide a choice of which
        layers to fold.

        layers_to_fold: A list with the index referring to the layer number,
                        and the element filled by an integer representing the
                        number of times the layer is folded.
