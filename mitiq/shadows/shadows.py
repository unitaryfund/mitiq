    This function returns the dictionary of the median of means estimation
    of Pauli fidelities: :math:`\{`"b": :math:`f_{b}\}_{b\in\{0,1\}^n}`.
    The number of :math:`f_b` is :math:`2^n`, or :math:`\sum_{i=1}^d C_n^i` if
    the locality :math:`d` is given.

    In the notation of :cite:`chen2021robust`, this function estimates the
    coefficient :math:`f_b`, which are expansion coefficients of the twirled
    channel :math:`\mathcal{M}=\sum_b f_b\Pi_b`.

    In practice, the output of this function can be used as calibration data
    for performing the classical shadows protocol in a way which is more
    robust to noise.

    Args:
        k_calibration: Number of groups of "median of means" used to solve for
            Pauli fidelity.
        locality: The locality of the operator, whose expectation value is
            going to be estimated by the classical shadow. e.g. if operator is
            Ising model Hamiltonian with nearest neighbor interaction, then
            locality = 2.
        zero_state_shadow_outcomes: The output of function
            :func:`shadow_quantum_processing` of zero calibrate state.
        qubits: The qubits to measure, needs to specify when the
            `zero_state_shadow_outcomes` is None.
        executor: The function to use to do quantum measurement, must be same
            as executor in `shadow_quantum_processing`. Needs to specify when
            the `zero_state_shadow_outcomes` is None.
        num_total_measurements_calibration: Number of shots per group of
            "median of means" used for calibration. Needs to specify when
            the `zero_state_shadow_outcomes` is None.
