    non-Clifford gates in the input circuit by Clifford gates.
    The way in which non-Clifford gates are selected to be replaced is
    determined by ``method_select`` and ``method_replace``.
    In the Clifford Data Regression (CDR) method
    :cite:`Czarnik_2021_Quantum`, data generated from these circuits is used
    as a training set to learn the effect of noise.

        circuit: A circuit of interest assumed to be compiled into the gate
            set {Rz, sqrt(X), CNOT}, or such that all the non-Clifford gates
            are contained in the Rz rotations.
        num_training_circuits: Number of circuits in the returned training set.
        fraction_non_clifford: The (approximate) fraction of non-Clifford
            gates in each returned circuit.
        method_select: Method by which non-Clifford gates are selected to be
            replaced by Clifford gates. Options are 'uniform' or 'gaussian'.
        method_replace: Method by which selected non-Clifford gates are
            replaced by Clifford gates. Options are 'uniform', 'gaussian' or
            'closest'.
        random_state: Seed for sampling.
        kwargs: Available keyword arguments are:
            - sigma_select (float): Width of the Gaussian distribution used for
            ``method_select='gaussian'``.
