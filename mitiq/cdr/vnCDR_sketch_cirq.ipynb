    "This notebook shows the skeleton for a working variable noise Clifford data regression (vnCDR) implementation for a given circuit. The vnCDR training set construction is completed using cirq simulators and virtual machines. A single instance of a random quantum circuit is used to explore performance relative to Clifford data regression (CDR) and ZNE with various functional extrapolations. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s review the vnCDR and CDR methods to remind ourselves of how these methods work and the elements necessary. vnCDR is the more general setting and is also expected to provide better mitigated results on average, so we will focus on the formalism for this method when presenting the necessary steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "## vnCDR \n",
    "vnCDR is a data driven error mitigation method. That means data from many quantum circuits is used to mitigate the effect of noise produced by one circuit of interest. vnCDR uses data from circuits which are classically simulable evaluated both classically (using a simulator) and on a real device at various levels of hardware noise. This data set is then used to train an ansatz mapping the noisy to exact data. The trained ansatz is used to mitigate the effect of the noise on the circuit of interest evaluated at different hardware noise levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, let $U$ be a quantum circuit which we are interested in, $|0 \\rangle$ its initial state, and $X$ an observable of interest. We want to estimate the expectation value $\\mu = \\langle 0|U^{+} X U |0 \\rangle$ from measurements on a noisy quantum device. We can mitigate the effect of noise using the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Clifford data) Choose a set of circuits $\\mathcal{S} = \\{V_i\\}_{i=1}^m$ based on $U$ which will be used to form the training set $\\mathcal{T}$ in step 3. The circuits in $\\mathcal{S}$ must be efficient to simulate classically, which is ensured by constructing them primarily from Clifford gates. The number of non-Cliffords used is denoted by $N$. Note that $N$ is assumed to be a constant parameter here, so the simulations are classically tractable. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- (Noise data) Choose a set of noise levels $\\mathcal{C}=\\{c_0,c_1,\\dots,c_n\\}$ where $1 = c_0 < c_1 < \\dots < c_n$ which will be used to form the training set $\\mathcal{T}$ in step 3. If the noise is characterized by a parameter $\\epsilon$ then running the device with noise level $c_j$ means the new parameter is $c_j\\epsilon$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- (Training set)  For each of the $m$ circuits $V_i$ in $\\mathcal{S}$ and $n+1$ noise levels $c_j\\in \\mathcal{C}$, produce an estimate of the observable expectation called $x_{i, j}$. Also, for each of the $m$ circuits compute $y_i = \\langle 0|V_i^{+} X V_i |0 \\rangle$ using a classical simulation. The training set $\\mathcal{T}$ is then defined as $\\mathcal{T} = \\{(\\vec{x}_i, y_i)\\}$ where $\\vec{x}_i = (x_{i,0},\\dots,x_{i,n})$ is the vector of noisy estimates originating from the $i^\\text{th}$ circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Learning) Learn a function $f : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that takes a set of noisy estimates at the $n+1$ different noise levels and outputs an estimate for the noise-free value. Specifically, we take the linear ansatz $g : \\mathbb{R}^n \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "           g(\\vec{x}; \\vec{a}) = \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{x}\\\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "    We use least-squares regression on the dataset $\\mathcal{T}$ to pick optimal parameters $\\vec{a}^*$, i.e.,\n",
    "    \\begin{align}\n",
    "        \\vec{a}^* = \\underset{\\vec{a}}{\\text{argmin}} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\left(y_i - g(\\vec{x}_i; \\vec{a})\\right)^2\\,,\n",
    "    \\end{align}\n",
    "    so that we expect $f(\\vec{x}) = g(\\vec{x}; \\vec{a}^*)$ to output a good estimate for the noise-free expected value given a vector of noisy ones.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- (Correction) Use the estimate $\\hat{\\mu} = \\vec{a}^*\\cdot\\vec{\\mu}$, where $\\vec{\\mu} = (\\hat{\\mu}_0,\\dots,\\hat{\\mu}_n)$ is comprised of the $n+1$ noisy expectations for the original circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CDR \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important distinctions between CDR and vnCDR. CDR does not use multiple hardware noise levels. Therefore there is not a vector of data for each circuit in the training set just a singular point. This also leads to the trianed ansatz being different. In the case of CDR the training set consisting of the noisy evaluated trianing circuits and their exact values are used to train a linear ansatz: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "           g(x; a, b) = ax + c.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important features\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important considerations when implementing vnCDR and CDR are how hardware noise is increased and how the circuits in the training set are constructed from the circuit of interest. In this sketch we present the simplest form of training set construction and hardware noise level increase. \n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the trianing set of classically simulable circuits here we randomly select a certain number of the non-Clifford gates in our circuit of interest and project them to their nearest Clifford gate, leaving $N$ non-Cliffords. This process is repeated $M$ times, giving a training set of size $M$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Noise is incrased by inserting identites formed of repeated CNOT gates. This is done using the unitary folding method provided in the mitiq package. \n",
    "\n",
    "The perforance of the mitigation is expected to converge with the number of non-Clifford gates in the training set circuits ($N$) and the number of circuits in the training set ($M$).\n",

    "Convergence is observed with training set size. In general the CDR method converges more slowly. When converged both regression methods show an improvement over linear ZNE, but their performance is very similar. Due to the training set construction method, the convergence observed can be very quick or more slow, depending on how lucky one gets when completeing the Clifford projections. It can also be quite discontinous without doing any repeats, so the above graph may appear a little odd.\n",
