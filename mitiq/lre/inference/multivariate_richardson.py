    $Mj(λ_i, d)$ is the basis of monomial terms for $l$-layers in the input
    circuit up to a specific degree $d$. The linear combination defines our
    polynomial of interest. In general, the number of monomial terms for a
    variable $l$ up to degree $d$  can be determined through the Stars and
    Bars method.

    We assume the terms in the monomial basis are arranged in a graded
    lexicographic order such that the terms with the highest total degree are
    considered to be the largest and the remaining terms are arranged in
    lexicographic order.

    For `degree=2, num_layers=2`, the monomial terms basis are
    ${1, x_1, x_2, x_1**2, x_1x_2, x_2**2}$ i.e. the function returns the

    Defines the function to find the linear combination coefficients from the
    sample matrix as required for multivariate extrapolation (defined in
    :cite:`Russo_2024_LRE`).

    We use the sample matrix to find the constants of linear combination
    $c = (c_1, c_2, …, c_M)$ associated with a known vector of noisy
    expectation values :math:`z = (\langle O(λ_1)\rangle,
    \langle O(λ_2)\rangle, ..., \langle O(λ_M)\rangle)^T`.

    The coefficients are found through the ratio of the determinants of $M_i$
    and the sample matrix. The new matrix $M_i$ is defined by replacing the ith
    row of the sample matrix with $e_1 = (1, 0, 0,..., 0)$.

        input_circuit: Circuit to be scaled.
