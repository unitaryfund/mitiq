# What happens when I use VD?
There are several steps that happen in the backend when you call the `vd.execute_with_vd` function

The diagram shows the workflow of the virtual distillation (VD) method in Mitiq.
```

In case you prefer a more detailed and theoretical explanation of the workflow, please view the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07064) describing VD (particularly **Algorithm 1**).

In the following sections we will provide a mitiq-specific workflow:

1. The user provides a `QPROGRAM`, which can be a quantum circuit created in any of the frontends supported by mitiq.
2. $M$ copies of $\rho$ (essentially $M$ copies of the circuit) are created
3. A series of SWAP gates are performed such that the qubits from the $M$ copies are aligned with each other
4. A basis change unitary is applied
5. A $B_i$ diagonalization gate is generated and applied to the circuits
5. The circuits are measured
6. The corrected expectation value is calculated
