# What additional options are available when using PT?

Currently Pauli Twirling is designed to have relatively few options, in part to make it readily composable with every other Mitiq technique. In the future, we expect a possibility of supporting additional operations as targets (beyond CZ and CNOT gates), with more customization on picking those targets. Stay tuned!
