Data validation and settings management using Python type hinting.

Fast and extensible, *pydantic* plays nicely with your linters/IDE/brain.
Define how data should be in pure, canonical Python 3.6+; validate it with *pydantic*.

## Help

See [documentation](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for more details.

## Installation

Install using `pip install -U pydantic` or `conda install pydantic -c conda-forge`.
For more installation options to make *pydantic* even faster,
see the [Install](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/install/) section in the documentation.

## A Simple Example

```py
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name = 'John Doe'
    signup_ts: Optional[datetime] = None
    friends: List[int] = []

external_data = {'id': '123', 'signup_ts': '2017-06-01 12:22', 'friends': [1, '2', b'3']}
user = User(**external_data)
print(user)
#> User id=123 name='John Doe' signup_ts=datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 1, 12, 22) friends=[1, 2, 3]
print(user.id)
#> 123
```

* Fix mypy complaints about most custom _pydantic_ types, [#2098](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2098) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Add a [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) plugin for easier [property-based testing](https://increment.com/testing/in-praise-of-property-based-testing/) with Pydantic's custom types - [usage details here](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/hypothesis_plugin/), [#2097](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2097) by [@Zac-HD](https://github.com/Zac-HD)

* Add merged `json_encoders` inheritance, [#2064](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2064) by [@art049](https://github.com/art049)
* allow overwriting `ClassVar`s in sub-models without having to re-annotate them, [#2061](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2061) by [@layday](https://github.com/layday)
* add default encoder for `Pattern` type, [#2045](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2045) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Add `NonNegativeInt`, `NonPositiveInt`, `NonNegativeFloat`, `NonPositiveFloat`, [#1975](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1975) by [@mdavis-xyz](https://github.com/mdavis-xyz)
* Use % for percentage in string format of colors, [#1960](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1960) by [@EdwardBetts](https://github.com/EdwardBetts)
* Fixed issue causing `KeyError` to be raised when building schema from multiple `BaseModel` with the same names declared in separate classes, [#1912](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1912) by [@JSextonn](https://github.com/JSextonn)
* Add `rediss` (Redis over SSL) protocol to `RedisDsn`
  Allow URLs without `user` part (e.g., `rediss://:pass@localhost`), [#1911](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1911) by [@TrDex](https://github.com/TrDex)
* Add a new `frozen` boolean parameter to `Config` (default: `False`).
  Setting `frozen=True` does everything that `allow_mutation=False` does, and also generates a `__hash__()` method for the model. This makes instances of the model potentially hashable if all the attributes are hashable, [#1880](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1880) by [@rhuille](https://github.com/rhuille)
* fix schema generation with multiple Enums having the same name, [#1857](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1857) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Added support for 13/19 digits VISA credit cards in `PaymentCardNumber` type, [#1416](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1416) by [@AlexanderSov](https://github.com/AlexanderSov)
* fix: prevent `RecursionError` while using recursive `GenericModel`s, [#1370](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1370) by [@xppt](https://github.com/xppt)
* use `enum` for `typing.Literal` in JSON schema, [#1350](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1350) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Fix: some recursive models did not require `update_forward_refs` and silently behaved incorrectly, [#1201](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1201) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Fix bug where generic models with fields where the typevar is nested in another type `a: List[T]` are considered to be concrete. This allows these models to be subclassed and composed as expected, [#947](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/947) by [@daviskirk](https://github.com/daviskirk)
* Add `Config.copy_on_model_validation` flag. When set to `False`, _pydantic_ will keep models used as fields
  untouched on validation instead of reconstructing (copying) them, [#265](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/265) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)

## v1.7.4 (2021-05-11)

* **Security fix:** Fix `date` and `datetime` parsing so passing either `'infinity'` or `float('inf')` 
  (or their negative values) does not cause an infinite loop,
  See security advisory [CVE-2021-29510](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-5jqp-qgf6-3pvh)

* keep the order of the fields when `validate_assignment` is set, [#2073](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2073) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* forward all the params of the stdlib `dataclass` when converted into _pydantic_ `dataclass`, [#2065](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/2065) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)

  Moreover nested dataclasses are also supported, [#744](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/744) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)

## v1.6.2 (2021-05-11)

  (or their negative values) does not cause an infinite loop,
  See security advisory [CVE-2021-29510](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/security/advisories/GHSA-5jqp-qgf6-3pvh)

## v1.6.1 (2020-07-15)

* fix validation and parsing of nested models with `default_factory`, [#1710](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1710) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)

## v1.6 (2020-07-11)

Thank you to pydantic's sponsors: [@matin](https://github.com/matin), [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo), [@chdsbd](https://github.com/chdsbd), [@jorgecarleitao](https://github.com/jorgecarleitao), and 1 anonymous sponsor for their kind support.

* Modify validators for `conlist` and `conset` to not have `always=True`, [#1682](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1682) by [@samuelcolvin](https://github.com/samuelcolvin)
* add port check to `AnyUrl` (can't exceed 65536) ports are 16 insigned bits: `0 <= port <= 2**16-1` src: [rfc793 header format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793#section-3.1), [#1654](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1654) by [@flapili](https://github.com/flapili)
* Document default `regex` anchoring semantics, [#1648](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1648) by [@yurikhan](https://github.com/yurikhan)
* Use `chain.from_iterable` in class_validators.py. This is a faster and more idiomatic way of using `itertools.chain`.
  Instead of computing all the items in the iterable and storing them in memory, they are computed one-by-one and never
  stored as a huge list. This can save on both runtime and memory space, [#1642](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1642) by [@cool-RR](https://github.com/cool-RR)

* Adjust handling of root validators so that errors are aggregated from _all_ failing root validators, instead of reporting on only the first root validator to fail, [#1586](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1586) by [@beezee](https://github.com/beezee)
* Make `__modify_schema__` on Enums apply to the enum schema rather than fields that use the enum, [#1581](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1581) by [@therefromhere](https://github.com/therefromhere)
* Fix behavior of `__all__` key when used in conjunction with index keys in advanced include/exclude of fields that are sequences, [#1579](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1579) by [@xspirus](https://github.com/xspirus)
* Subclass validators do not run when referencing a `List` field defined in a parent class when `each_item=True`. Added an example to the docs illustrating this, [#1566](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1566) by [@samueldeklund](https://github.com/samueldeklund)
* change `schema.field_class_to_schema` to support `frozenset` in schema, [#1557](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1557) by [@wangpeibao](https://github.com/wangpeibao)
* Call `__modify_schema__` only for the field schema, [#1552](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1552) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Move the assignment of `field.validate_always` in `fields.py` so the `always` parameter of validators work on inheritance, [#1545](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1545) by [@dcHHH](https://github.com/dcHHH)
* Added support for UUID instantiation through 16 byte strings such as `b'\x12\x34\x56\x78' * 4`. This was done to support `BINARY(16)` columns in sqlalchemy, [#1541](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1541) by [@shawnwall](https://github.com/shawnwall)
* Add a test assertion that `default_factory` can return a singleton, [#1523](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1523) by [@therefromhere](https://github.com/therefromhere)
* Add `NameEmail.__eq__` so duplicate `NameEmail` instances are evaluated as equal, [#1514](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1514) by [@stephen-bunn](https://github.com/stephen-bunn)

* Avoid some side effects of `default_factory` by calling it only once
  if possible and by not setting a default value in the schema, [#1491](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1491) by [@PrettyWood](https://github.com/PrettyWood)
* Added docs about dumping dataclasses to JSON, [#1487](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1487) by [@mikegrima](https://github.com/mikegrima)
* Make `BaseModel.__signature__` class-only, so getting `__signature__` from model instance will raise `AttributeError`, [#1466](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1466) by [@MrMrRobat](https://github.com/MrMrRobat)
* include `'format': 'password'` in the schema for secret types, [#1424](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1424) by [@atheuz](https://github.com/atheuz)
* Modify schema constraints on `ConstrainedFloat` so that `exclusiveMinimum` and
  minimum are not included in the schema if they are equal to `-math.inf` and
  `exclusiveMaximum` and `maximum` are not included if they are equal to `math.inf`, [#1417](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1417) by [@vdwees](https://github.com/vdwees)

* Remove extra `allOf` from schema for fields with `Union` and custom `Field`, [#1209](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1209) by [@mostaphaRoudsari](https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari)
* Updates OpenAPI schema generation to output all enums as separate models.
  Instead of inlining the enum values in the model schema, models now use a `$ref`
  property to point to the enum definition, [#1173](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues/1173) by [@calvinwyoung](https://github.com/calvinwyoung)

## v1.5.1 (2020-04-23)
